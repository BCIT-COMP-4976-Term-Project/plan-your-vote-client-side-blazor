            <span class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">
                Add your response to the Capital Plan borrowing questions to your plan. The ballot will have 3 "yes" or "no"
                questions on whether the City can borrow $300 million to help pay for projects in the Capital Plan. The
                2019-2022 Capital Plan invests $300,000,000 in City facilities and infrastructure to provide services to the
                people of Vancouver. If a majority of voters vote yes, then City Council can borrow the funds for these
                projects.
